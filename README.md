# tri-axial-probe

This a project to create an open source 3D probe for DIY CNC people. We have a goal of providing the basic design and instructions for building.  Component kits may be available.  

Currently, a PCB is just entering the testing phase. There are multiple versions that will be made available.  These may also be available for sale

## Project Goals

1. Create an easy to make design for CNC enthusiasts/hobbyists.
2. Machinable on hobby level CNC mills/routers.
3. Costs less than $75 (need to sanity check this).
4. Accuracy better than 0.1mm (need sanity check, can we do better?).
5. Allow use of higher accuracy components, especially probe tips.
6. Usable with common CNC controllers including (but not limited to) Mach 3, Mach 4, Grbl, grblHAL, LinuxCNC.
7. Support for height map probing.
8. Usable with 6 to 24V input power. Stretch goal of supporting 5V.
