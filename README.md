# tri-axial-probe

This a project to create an open source 3D probe for DIY CNC people. We have a goal of providing the basic design and instructions for building.  Component kits may be available.  

Currently, a PCB is just entering the testing phase. There are multiple versions that will be made available.  These may also be available for sale
